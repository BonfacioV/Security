    "explanation": "Salting (D) adds random data to passwords before hashing to make brute-force and rainbow table attacks more difficult."
  },
  {
    "question": "Question 3:\nAn employee clicked a link in an email from a payment website that asked the employee to update contact information. The employee entered the log-in information but received a 'page not found' error message. Which of the following types of social engineering attacks occurred?",
